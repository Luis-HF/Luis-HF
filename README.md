# Computer Science Student | Software Engineering

I am a Computer Science student (4th period) at UTFPR focused on building efficient, scope-driven software. My technical background ranges from low-level systems architecture to modern full-stack development.

## Core Competencies
I prioritize software engineering principles over framework dependency, treating technology as a tool to solve specific architectural challenges.

* **Low-Level & Systems:** Proficiency in C and MIPS Assembly. Strong understanding of Computer Architecture and Organization.
* **Backend Development:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django), and RESTful API design.
* **Frontend & Integration:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for decoupled web applications.
* **Data Management:** Relational database modeling (MER), SQL, and PostgreSQL.
* **Environments:** Advanced Linux user with experience in networking fundamentals and system optimization.

## Portfolio Highlights
* **MIPS Processor:** A complete documented implementation of a MIPS processor architecture.
### 💈 Barbershop Management System
> **Full-stack Web Application** developed in a collaborative GitHub Organization.

**Key Features:**
* **Team Collaboration:** Developed in a trio using **Git Flow** and organization-based repositories.
* **Architecture:** Focused on **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with Django Templates and MVT pattern.
* **Security:** Integrated authentication and administrative control panels.
